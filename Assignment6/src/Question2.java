/*
* ArrayList - holds only value
* LinkedList - holds value as well as reference to the neighbouring objects
*
* Adding objects to LinkedList is faster compared to ArrayList as in case of the latter, there is an overhead of checking,
* resizing and copying the items from the ArrayList when it fills up.
